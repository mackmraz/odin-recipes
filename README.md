First Odin Foundation's Project with HTML

This is my first official HTML made site on Linux platform pushing out to GitHub to round out my HTML learning process. Overall this lesson helped me learn all the basics of GIT, GitHub, HTML, VS Code all while running these inside a virtual machine with Linux as the OS.
